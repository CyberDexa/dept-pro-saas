Since we're getting authentication errors, let's set up a working database quickly.

## Option 1: Use Railway (Fastest)

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Choose "Provision PostgreSQL"
4. Copy the PostgreSQL URL from the Variables tab
5. Use it in the next steps

## Option 2: Use Supabase (Free)

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Create new project
3. Wait for setup to complete
4. Go to Settings > Database
5. Copy the connection string

## For now, let me set up a temporary solution

Let me configure the deployed app with proper environment variables in Vercel.
